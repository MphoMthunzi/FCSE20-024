 <h1 style="font-style: bold;">THE HISTORY OF Paris</h1><br>
<img class="mySlides" src="Images/history.jpg" style="width:40%">
   <ol>         
<li>Paris, France's capital and river port (population: 2,153,600 in 2005; metro area: 9,854,000).It can now be found on both sides of the Seine. Lutetia, the initial settlement from which Paris arose, was<br>established on an island in the Seine by the late third century BCE.In 52 BCE, the Romans seized and fortified Lutetia.</li><br>

<li>The city expanded to the left side of the Seine during the first century CE. It became known as Paris in the early fourth century.It survived three Viking sieges (885â€“887) and became<br>France's capital in 987, when Hugh Capet, the count of Paris, was crowned king.</li><br>


<li>During the reign of Philip II, the city was improved, and the University of Paris was formally acknowledged in 1200.The Black Death and the Hundred Years' War hampered<br> its development in the 14th and 15th centuries.It was improved and beautified in the 17th and 18th centuries.</li><br>

<li>Paris was the epicenter of the French Revolution from 1789 until 1799. Georges-Eugene Haussmann was commissioned by Napoleon III to upgrade the city's infrastructure and construct numerous new bridges across the Seine.The Paris Peace Conference, which concluded World War I, was held in the city.During World War II, German troops invaded Paris.</li><br>
 
<li>It has become France's financial, commercial, transportation, artistic, and intellectual hub.The Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame de Paris, the Louvre, the Pantheon, the Pompidou Centre, and<br>The Paris Opera, as well as boulevards, public parks, and gardens, are among the city's many attractions.</li><br>

<li>The Bank of England was founded in 1694 and was first governed by Huguenot John Houblon, who helped turn London into an international financial powerhouse. By 1840, the city had swollen to 2 million people, often crowded into unsanitary hovels, which helped create epidemics of cholera and other diseases.</li><br>

<li>During the reign of Queen Victoria, London was well established as the prestigious seat of the vast British Empire, and while Big Ben rose above the city in 1859, the London Underground opened in 1863 as the world s first subterranean railway. But in the shadows of the great metropolis, Jack the Ripper stalked the city s women in 1888, killing at least five in one of history s most notorious murder sprees.</li><br>

<li>Air raids caused about 2,300 casualties in London in World War I, and during the Battle of Britain in World War II, the city was bombed relentlessly by the German Luftwaffe the<br>London Blitz eventually killed about 30,000 residents.</li><br>

<li>During the Great Smog of 1952, Londoners endured immeasurable suffering and thousands died during and after the pollution event.<br>More recently, a terrorist attack on the London transit system killed 56 people in 2005. But the city has continued to grow and prosper, hosting the 2012 Olympics, while establishing itself as the preeminent cultural and financial center of Europe.</li>
